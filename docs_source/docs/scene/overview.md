# SceneFeature
SceneFeatures are things which impact the entire scene. They do not have a location or transformation in the world. These include everything from DirectionalLight to Post Processing effects. 

# SceneObject
Every object you see in a scene is represented by a SceneObject. SceneObjects are made up of a series of components that influence how the object will look, how it will behave, etc. A SceneObject can be built on the fly by adding components, or it can be loaded from an existing template.
